# webWorks
A framework that can tailor a project specifically to your needs by installing only the desired modules

# AS OF 2025/10/01

# Existing Modules
The existing modules no longer work with this updated code base and will no longer be individually
updated. Development has switched into using the Module Maker SDK, so that all the duplicate code can
now be centralized and managed so that a change in one location affects every call throughout the
project. Construction of Module Maker is coming to a close soon so updating each existing module
can be performed rapidly. Hopefully by the end of October 2025, all the existing modules will be able
to work on the 8.x branch of PHP (currently they only work with 7.x).

Although a fresh install of this project will allow access to two default modules, Application
Settings and Employees, only the former will work as the latter has yet to be updated (which will
occur with Module Maker).

# Catch-22
There is currently a situation where this software can NOT utilize the online repo to install modules
due to the Cliquesoft website using an old version of this very software. The website will need to be
updated with a new version before the online repo will work again. However, anyone wishing to work with
Module Maker can simply download the installation file and manually add it through the Application
Settings module (via the 'Modules' tab).

# Notes
Typically we try to keep our software up-to-date with modern versions of PHP. Since Covid was introduced
to the world, there has been some delay in this process. In the years since, supply chains, jobs, and
daily life has returned to a more typical operation, and as such a return to development has been underway.
This release marks very big changes to the software that has taken over a year to implement. There is
still a bit that needs to be done to get a "fine oiled machine", but we are working on it diligently.
Anyone interested in helping is more than welcomed to join!
